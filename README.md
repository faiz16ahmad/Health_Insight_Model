# HealthInsight: Healthcare Analytics Platform

## Introduction
HealthInsight is a comprehensive healthcare analytics platform that combines machine learning with a user-friendly web interface to provide two key medical predictions:
1. Stroke Risk Assessment
2. Disease Diagnosis

The project implements the complete machine learning lifecycleâ€”from data preprocessing to model deploymentâ€”creating reliable healthcare prediction systems accessible through an intuitive web interface.

## Features
- **Stroke Risk Prediction:** Assess stroke risk based on health parameters
- **Disease Diagnosis:** Predict possible diseases based on symptoms
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Easy-to-use Streamlit application
- **Pre-trained Models:** Ready-to-use machine learning models
- **Data Visualization:** Comprehensive health insights with visual representations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.4 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suvramoy/HealthInsight.git
cd HealthInsight
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
# On Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
